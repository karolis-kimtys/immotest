# IMMO Test

Project was built using React and TypeScript. 
Code test written using React Testing Library. 
All styles have been custom written using CSS.
Global state is managed using React useContext hook. 
TypeScript is using Strict mode, but to finish the project quicker, quite few "any" types used, so TypeScript type checking is relaxed.
